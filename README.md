# hn_bot - Automated Archive Finder for HackerNews Posts
A Bot that searches for and posts links to archived versions of articles after scanning all of HackerNews' top articles for those that contain a link to a site that requires a subscription.

## Process 
The Program follows **4 steps** :
        
        1. It collects all of HackerNews' top, new, and best posts.

        2. Identifies which posts include links to articles on websites with subscription blocks.
            (i.e. After a certain number of articles, you must pay to read them.)

        3. Locates the articles' archived snapshots.
            - WaybackMachine is mostly used because archive.today (archive.ph) uses Cloudflare, which has a very robust bot detector.

        4. Leaves a comment with a link to the Archived snapshot.
    
    
    
## State Of Project 
Unfortunately, the application was blocked by the infamous moderator of HackerNews, **@dang**, because bot = bad ðŸ™„
However, the program works perfectly 

## Future Plans

I enjoyed learning about building a bot and using APIs while also discovering a whole new field of computer science.
So, even if **@dang** is ruining my project, I'm not going to fight him.


- I hope someone finds this project entertaining or useful 
- Feel free to expand on this and build something cool (or even ðŸ¤« something that is undetectable ðŸ˜‰)
