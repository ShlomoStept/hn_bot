# hn_bot - Automated Archive Finder for HackerNews Posts
Searches all HackerNews top posts for links to websites that require a subscription, then find & posts a link to an archived snapshot of the article

## Process 
The Program follows **4 steps** :

        1. It grabs all the top, new and, best posts on HackerNews.
    
        2. Determines which posts contain links to articles on websites that have subscription blocks.
                - after x articles they require you to pay to read) 
    
        3. Find the Archived snapshots of the articles.
                - Mainly using WaybackMachine, since archive.today (archive.ph), utilizes Cloudflare - whose bot detector is very robust
    
        4. Post a link to the Archived snapshot as a Comment for that post.
    
    
    
## State Of Project 
The program works perfectly, Unfortunately **@dang** ( HackerNewsâ€™s Infamous moderator ) blocked my bot, because bot = bad ðŸ™„

## Future Plans
I had fun exploring creating a bot, using API's and learned a lot about an area of CS that I knew nothing about beforehand. 
So, I'm not going to fight **@dang** even though heâ€™s killing my project.

- I hope someone finds this project useful or fun, 
- feel free to expand on this and build something cool (or even ðŸ¤« something that evades detection ðŸ˜‰)
